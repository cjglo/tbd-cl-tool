# tbd-cl-tool
Haven't decided exact nature of the command tool I will build, but after the rust book went through recreating grep with rust, I decided to try something similar out with typescript.



### Dependecies
tsc (type-script cross compiler)
ts-node (node compiler for typescript)
@types/node (type defintions for node)
